# Starbucks offers: Advanced customer segmentation with Python

A small startup may rely on broad-stroke rules and general demographics to target its users effectively.  

However, as a company scales to the size of Starbucks—serving millions of daily customers and managing $1.6 billion in credit stored on loyalty cards—it necessitates a more advanced and data-driven marketing strategy.  

One such technique is cluster analysis, which employs mathematical models to identify groups of customers with similar characteristics, based on variations in demographics, purchasing behavior, and other factors.  

In this analysis, I examined a customer transaction and marketing offer dataset generously provided by Starbucks. Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the k-means clustering algorithm, and DBSCAN, I segmented customers into distinct clusters to facilitate the automation of a targeted and effective outreach campaign.
